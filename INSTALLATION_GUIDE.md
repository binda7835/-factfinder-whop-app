# Whop App Installation Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Your App is Ready to Install!

Your Whop app is now fully functional and ready to be installed into a Whop.

## ðŸ“‹ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Access Your App Installation Link

Your app installation link is:
```
https://whop.com/apps/app_jTgw6sHKplCJi3/install
```

### Step 2: Install the App

1. **Click the installation link above** or go to your [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/)
2. **Find your app** in the list
3. **Click "Install"** on your app
4. **Select a Whop** where you want to install the app
5. **Confirm the installation**

### Step 3: Configure App Paths

In your Whop Developer Dashboard, make sure these paths are set:

- **App path:** `/experiences/[experienceId]`
- **Dashboard path:** `/dashboard/[companyId]`
- **Discover path:** `/discover`
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000` (for development)

### Step 4: Test Your App

1. **Go to the Whop** where you installed the app
2. **Navigate to the Tools section**
3. **Find your app** and click on it
4. **Your app should load** within the Whop iframe

## ðŸ”§ Development Testing

### Using Development Proxy (Recommended)

I can see from your terminal logs that the development proxy is already working! You're getting requests like:
```
GET /experiences/exp_X7te3UXkTrbRSQ?whop-dev-user-token=...
```

This means:
- âœ… **Development proxy is active**
- âœ… **User tokens are being passed**
- âœ… **Your app is receiving real Whop data**

### Alternative: Direct Browser Testing

You can also test directly in the browser:
- **Home page:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Experience page:** `http://localhost:3000/experiences/test123`
- **Dashboard page:** `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/test456`
