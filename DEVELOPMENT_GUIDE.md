# Whop App Development Guide

## 🎉 Success! Your App is Running

Your Whop Next.js app is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Development server running** at `http://localhost:3000`  
✅ **Dependencies installed** successfully  
✅ **Environment variables configured**  
✅ **Error handling added** for development mode  

## 🔧 What You're Seeing

### Home Page (`/`)
- Welcome page with setup instructions
- Shows your environment variables (masked for security)
- Installation link for your Whop app

### Experience Page (`/experiences/[experienceId]`)
- **Development Mode**: Shows a friendly development message
- **Production Mode**: Will show real user data when accessed through Whop

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Your App in Whop
1. Go to [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/)
2. Find your app and click "Install"
3. Add it to a Whop's tools section
4. Access it through the Whop interface

### 2. Use Development Proxy (Recommended)
The template includes a development proxy for easier testing:
```bash
npm run dev  # Uses whop-proxy for iframe testing
```

### 3. Customize Your App
- **Pages**: Edit files in `app/` directory
- **Styling**: Modify `app/globals.css` or use Tailwind classes
- **API**: Add routes in `app/api/` directory
- **Components**: Create reusable components

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (with proxy)
npm run dev

# Start development server (npm only)
npm run dev:npm

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## 📁 Key Files

- `app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx` - Experience page
- `app/dashboard/[companyId]/page.tsx` - Dashboard page
- `lib/whop-sdk.ts` - Whop SDK configuration
- `.env.development.local` - Your environment variables

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Whop user token not found" Error
- **Normal in development**: This happens when accessing directly in browser
- **Solution**: Use the Whop development proxy or access through Whop interface

### Tailwind CSS Warnings
- **Normal**: These are just warnings about ES modules
- **App still works**: The warnings don't affect functionality

### Multiple Lockfiles Warning
- **Normal**: Next.js detects both npm and pnpm lockfiles
- **Solution**: Can be ignored or remove unused lockfile

## 🎯 Your App is Ready!

Your Whop app is now fully functional and ready for development. The error you saw was expected behavior - it's now handled gracefully with a development-friendly message.

Happy coding! 🚀
